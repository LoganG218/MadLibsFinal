# MadLibsFinal
Final project for Code Kentucky
This is my take on a game I played a lot as a kid, Mad Libs. The three features I chose are the master loop, an additional class, and implementing a log that writes to a text file. As the game starts up, you will be prompted to pick a number 1 through 4 and options 1, 2, and 3 are all different "stories". After you have completed the Mad Lib, it will save as a .txt document.
